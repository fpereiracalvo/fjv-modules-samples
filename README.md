# General

This repository has samples for Fjv.Modules library to show how to use it. You can add modules to try new features or to test your own modules.

## Samples

- WebConsole
  This sample shows how to use the library in a web application.

  Why a command line web application? Because it is the easiest way and versatile mode to show how to use the library. You can see this library in action without the need to install anything. Just open the web page and start typing commands.

Other samples will be added soon.
